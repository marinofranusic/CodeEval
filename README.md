# CodeEval
These are my solutions for the challenges on the CodeEval website (www.codeeval.com).
I have been solving these challenges for fun using C++, C# and Pyhton. There is rule when I am using any of these languages,
I'm just shuffling them.
You can see my CodeEval profile on https://www.codeeval.com/profile/mfranusic/.

#Using the files
You can freely use all the files and solutions provided here. If you are actually solving the challenges on the CodeEval,
try to solve them by yourself and consult other people's solutions only if you are stuck and want to learn.
